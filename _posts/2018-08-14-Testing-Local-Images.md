title: Maximizing the New York Minute
---

Weaving through the NYC subway commute, an untrained eye would see only chaos amongst the 6 million daily passengers. A data scientist, however, would see an intricate data set for answering a key marketing question - how to maximize market exposure while minimizing costs. And thinking like a data scientist is the first step of my data science bootcamp journey. 

Given a client’s question on where and when to strategically place street teams, MTA turnstile recordings provides a myriad of open source data for completing this request. It also provides an opportunity for me to learn more about the data science approach as well as providing a minimum viable product for a client.

My team’s approach was to combine data science techniques with key intuitions in order to maximize both quantity and quality. 

This concept stated as an equation would be: 
Reach = Impressions x Conversion Rate
         Where:
Impressions : Data Science
Conversion Rate : Intuition

First  we aimed to maximize the street team’s conversion rate by placing them in key areas where the average commuter would be most interested in the organization’s mission. The next step would be to maximize the volume of foot traffic the street teams could meet by finding the stations within the selected regions with the highest average hourly passenger hour.

The client provided the following goals:
  1. Build Awareness
  2. Fill event space
  3. Increase Donor Pool

Additional to the goals, we were also provided that the event space would be held in the Lower East Side on the cusp of Summer. From here we built our investigation on three core foundations to reach NYer most likely to be in our market segment:
  1. Direct access to the Gala location
  2. High tech industry density
  3. Affluent Areas

With some reconnisounce on industry in the Big Apple we able to focus our search in Manhattan’s “Silicon Alley” and the Brooklyn Tech Triangular. We specifically focused on stations along the Brown, Green, and Orange lines, since these allow the easier access to the Gala space. From these constraints we chose about 20 stations to focus on in our analysis.

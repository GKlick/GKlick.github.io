title: Maximizing the New York Minute
---

Weaving through the NYC subway commute, an untrained eye would see only chaos amongst the 6 million daily passengers. A data scientist, however, would see an intricate data set for answering a key marketing question - how to maximize market exposure while minimizing costs. And thinking like a data scientist is the first step of my data science bootcamp journey. 

Given a clientâ€™s question on where and when to strategically place street teams, MTA turnstile recordings provides a myriad of open source data for completing this request. It also provides an opportunity for me to learn more about the data science approach as well as providing a minimum viable product for a client.
